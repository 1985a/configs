(Biggie) 
Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us 
Straight up weed no angel dust, label us Notorious 
Thug ass niggaz that love to bust, it's strange to us 
Y'all niggaz be scramblin, gamblin 
Up in restaraunts with mandolins, and violins 
We just sittin here tryin to win, tryin not to sin 
High off weed and lots of gin 
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily countin them Benjamins 
Nigga you'd should too, if you knew 
What this game would do to you 
Been in this shit since ninety-two 
Look at all the bullshit I been through 
So-called beef with you know who 
Fucked a few female stars or two 
Then I bluelight niggaz knew like Mike, shit 
Not to be fucked with 
Motherfucker better duck quick, cause 
Me and my dogs love to buck shit 
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim 
No aspirations to quit the game 
Spit yo' game, talk yo' shit 
Grab yo' gat, call yo' clique 
Squeeze yo' clip, hit the right one 
Pass that weed, I got to light one 
All them niggaz I got to fight one 
All them hoes I got to like one 
Our situation is a tight one 
Whatcha gonna do, fight or run? 
Seems to me that you'll take b 
Bone and Big, nigga die slowly 
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me 
Cash Rules Everything Around Me 
Shit, lyrically, niggaz can't see me 
Fuck it, buy the coke 
Cook the coke, cut it, 
Know the bitch before you caught yourself lovin it 
Nigga with a Benz fuckin it 
Doesn't it seem odd to you 
BIG come through with mobs and crews 
Goodfellas down with the Mo Thugs crew 
Who's the killa, me or you? 

(We forgive you for you know not what you do) 

(Bizzy) 
Its seven A.M. woke in the mornin 
With Henney, Caffeine and green and nicotine 
No dough so pop a couple of those 
Lil Ripstas, nigga Mista Clean 
Make it gleam deep in my temple and I'll go get 
Sentimentally esteamed, wit my 
Instrumelodies, and heated 
Especially for your team 
And the forty-five indeed will beam 
In between the seams, destroyin your dreams 
You willin to die, we'll see 
How many flee when I cause the scene 
We mean mug, Mo Thugs 
Trained to be perfect disciples 
When it's survival tongue by the double-edged sword 
Triple, six rivals spittin fire 
This the real truth, bitch 
Breakin out for lies 
My Messiahs better be ready for Armageddeon six-six-five 
It's wild, bless the child 
The one that became a man 
Put in positions already there 
All that I had to do was stare 
Test me now, contend never no surrender no pretend 
Pick up my pen, in my hand 
One of my trusted fine friends, hey 
Open 'n let em see if we real, we all suited 
Beg my pardon to Martin 
Baby we ain't marchin, we shootin' 
And daily recruitin there's a thug born 
Everyday in the ghetto 
We start em off little we give em a bottle 
And a pen and a pad to hit the lead now kick it 

(Krayzie) 
Nigga roll wit Bone up into the Thug spot 
To the dome wit a shot of bird 
Never get tossed to the curb 
Be feelin that urge to splurge 
But I'm broke as fuck son gimme that Mossberg swerve 
Up into my bag, cause I gotta get my mask and shells 
To put in this twelve gauge sawed off 
Get em all off, nigga yo' loss, take it all off 
Got a nigga car door 
But the Bone not Leatherface, too many are thinkin they Thugs 
They need the most help to pull it in doves 
And bitch if you stickin we buckin them guns, tha's fucked up 
Now let me get done with the grime 
Gotta go purchase a dime 
Put in a state to get done with the crime 
Smokin the reefer to ease my mind 
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks 
But Willie be servin em dummies, see 
Gotta buck him on down if he come back talkin 
Like gimme back me money 
Thuggin with me killers, need us a liter 
Of liquor but niggaz ain't got shit 
Wit a sawed off pump chrome thirty-eight pistol 
Now who ready to get bent 
Nigga like me feenin for them green leaves 
But I ain't had no dough 
Gotta make some money so 
I'm makin my dummy rocks if I go broke 

Chorus: Intro 3, Intro 2 

(Layzie) 
Yeah, Little Lay hey comin in the form of scripture 
Finna get ya and hit ya wit magic 
Droppin down licks betta call on my gadgets 
With a automatic status we spray time to load the glocks 
But I'm thinkin not 
There's another evil force tellin me do what I gotta do 
So I up ma force, a nigga dyin tonight 
And I'm always runnin from the boys in blue 
Biggie booms on my a$$ now provide the cellular phone 
To call Bone, what's happenin 
Grab artillery niggaz start packin 
Cause a motherfucker try to get me in the jackin, and I did him 
Hit him right between the eyes, the spot was wise 
Wanna test a nigga size, and it cost him 
Nigga fuck around wit the wrong shit 
Y'all get mo murdered all day all day 
We done paved the way and I'm on the run 
I'ma call my boys and bring all the guns 
Y'all niggaz wanna have a little fun wit number one (one)
That red red rum rum rum rum rum rum 
That red red rum rum rum rum rum rum 
That red red rum..
