$(document).ready(function(e) {    $(".protected").disableSelection();         
         
         });I can't fool myself I don't want nobody else to ever love me  
         
You are my shining star my guiding light my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of ya
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you 
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say "I love you"
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in
 
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you 
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop 
Oh my love, a million days in your arms 
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop
Never too much, never too much
Never too much, never too much
 
Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up but you weren't there and I was broken hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demandin'
Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standin'
Who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar?
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winnin'
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning
 
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you 
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop 
Oh my love, a million days in your arms 
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you is never
A thousand kisses from you
A thousand kisses from you is never to much---"Never Too Much [A3M Dub Mix]" as written by Luther VandrossLyrics Â© EMI Music PublishingLyrics powerd by LyricFind
