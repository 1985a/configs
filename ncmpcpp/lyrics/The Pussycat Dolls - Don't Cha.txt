Ok
Yeah
Oh, we about to get it just a little hot and sweaty in this muhfucker
(Oh, baby)
Ladies let's go

Soldiers let's go
Let me talk to y'all and just you know
Give you a little situation... listen
(Fellas)

You see this shit get hot
Every time I come through when I step up in the spot
(Are you ready?)
Make the place sizzle like a summertime cookout
Prowl for the best chick, yes I'm on the lookout
(Let's dance)

Slow bangin' shawty like a belly dancer with it
Smell good, pretty skin, so gangsta with it
(Oh, baby)
No tricks only diamonds under my sleeve
Give me the number
But make sure you call before you leave

Pussycat Dolls
I know you like me
I know you do
That's why whenever I come around
She's all over you

I know you want it
It's easy to see
And in the back of your mind
I know you should be fuckin' with me baby

Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Don't cha?
Don't cha?

Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha?
Don't cha?

Fight the feeling
Leave it alone
'Cause if it ain't love
It just ain't enough to leave my happy home

Let's keep it friendly
You have to play fair
See I don't care
But I know she ain't gonna wanna share

Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Oh
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Like me
Don't cha?

Don't cha baby?
Don't cha?
Alright, I'm saying
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?

Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Baby

Okay, I see how it's goin' down
Seems like shawty wanna little menage pop off or somethin', let's go
Well let me get straight to it
Every broad wan watch a nigga when I come through it
It's the God Almighty, lookin' all brand new

If shawty wanna jump in my ass then vanjewish
Lookin' at me all like she really wanna do it
Tryin' to put it on me till my balls black an blueish
You wanna play wit uh player girl then play on
Strip out the Chanel
And leave the lingerie on

Watch me and I'm a watch you at the same time
Lookin' at you wan break my back
You the very reason why I keep a pack uh the Magnum
An wit the wagon hit you in the back of the magnum

For the record, don't think it was somethin' you did
Shawty all on me 'cause it's hard to resist the kid
I got a idea that's dope for y'all
As y'all could get so I could hit the both of y'all
