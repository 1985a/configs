Aping my soul
You stole my overture
Trapped in God's program
Oh, I can't escape

Who are we, where are we?
When are we, why are we?
Who are we, where are we?
Why, why, why?

I can't forgive you
And I can't forget

Who are we, where are we?
When are we, why are we?
Who are we, where are we?
When are we, why are we in here?
