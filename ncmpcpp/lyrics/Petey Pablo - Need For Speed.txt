Need for Speed
I got a need for speed
I got a need for speed
I got a need for speed
I got a need for speed

When the cops come all I hear is whoopwhoopwhoop
Said when the cops come all I hear is whoopwhoopwhoop
Said when the cops come all I hear is whoopwhoopwhoop

I got a
I got a
I got a
I got a
I got a

Foot on the pedal
Pressin' the gas
Gotta
Switch in the middle
That's close to my hand
Grab a Skull Head
Come time me shift gear
When I hear it chirp
I know everthing work
My Neeer

See ya later alligator
I'm Gone
Dippin' trucks,duckin' cars
Watch out for the wall
I can hold my own
Out here on the dangerous road
Tryin' to find me like a diamond
In a pecan grove
I got Ozone
Man I like rock n roll
Like ta bump it
Just as my car come around the last corner
Gotta take it home
Want nuttin' less than the the goal
Get your roll on
Show 'em what the low pro's for
Show 'em what Donald Don
Uncle Brutha' did to the motor
I got heat control
and the access codes
You can't handle it Boss
Better let your man jump on it
My need for speed
Slam out the window dog

I got a need for speed
I got a need for speed
I got a need for speed
I got a need for speed

When the cops come all I hear is whoopwhoopwhoop
Said when the cops come all I hear is whoopwhoopwhoop
Said when the cops come all I hear is whoopwhoopwhoop

I got a
I got a
I got a
I got a

Whether it's a stick shift or an automatic
Get through the razzle,can perform magic
And I don't do rabbits
I make it happen on the track
'cause
When the flag falls
That's all she wrote
Give the boy some breathin' room
'Bout ta get loose
And whoohoo, get ta' actin' a fool
I pay my dues
Never time ta' break the rules
Cuz
You just a dot in my rearview
I barely can spot ya'
Behind? I don't hear you.
Pretty damn pitiful
I'm tryin' to be serious too
Your car ain't the problem boss
The car should get rid of you
I'm a talk to your captain too
Tell him you're killing the groove
Singin' the right song
But playin' the wrong music
My transmission fluid
cost more than your dashboard
I'm out here e'ryday
When you can't stay long
You can't play ball
In traffic with flying cars
I can't give you no warning
My car ain't gotta horn

I got a need for speed
I got a need for speed
I got a need for speed
I got a need for speed

When the cops come all I hear is whoopwhoopwhoop
Said when the cops come all I hear is whoopwhoopwhoop
Said when the cops come all I hear is whoopwhoopwhoop

I got a
I got a
I got a
I got a

Need for speed
See ya later Alligator

Need for speed
Need for speed
Need for speed

See ya later alligator
I'm gone
gone
gone
gone
See ya later alligator
I'm gone

I got a need for speed
I got a need for speed
I got a need for speed
I got a need for speed

When the cops come all I hear is whoopwhoopwhoop
Said when the cops come all I hear is whoopwhoopwhoop
Said when the cops come all I hear is whoopwhoopwhoop

I got a
I got a
