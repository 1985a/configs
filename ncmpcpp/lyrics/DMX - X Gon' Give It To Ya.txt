Fuck what you heard, it's what you hearin' (What you hearin')

X gon' give it to ya (What?)
Fuck waitin' for you to get it on your own
X gon' deliver to ya
Knock knock, open up the door it's real
With the non-stop pop-pop of stainless steel
Go hard gettin' busy wit it
But I got such a good heart
That I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it
Damn right, and I'll do it again (Yeah)
'Cause I am right, so I gots to win
Break bread with the enemy (What?)
No matter how many cats I break bread with
I'll break who you sendin' me (Yeah!)
You motherfuckers never wanted nothin' but your life saved
Bitch, and that's for the light day
I'm gettin down, down, make a nigga say "freeze!"
But won't be the one endin' up on his knees, bitch please!
If the only thing you cats did was came out to play
Stay out my way motherfucker

First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, don't let it go (What?)
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya
First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, don't let it go
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya

Ain't never gave nothin' to me
But every time I turn around
Cats got they hands out wantin' somethin' from me
I ain't got it so you can't get it (Yeah!)
Let's leave it at that 'cause I ain't wit it (Yeah!)
Hit it wit full strength, I'm a jail nigga
So I face the world like it's Earl in the bullpen
You against me, me against you
Whatever, whenever, nigga, the fuck you gon' do?
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothin' (What?)
Only nigga that you know that can chill
Come back and get the streets open
I've been doing this for nineteen years (What?)
Niggas wanna fight me? Fight these tears (What?)
I put in work and it's all for the kids
But these cats done forgot what work is (Uh-huh!)
They don't know who we be (Lookin'!)
But they don't know who they see, nigga!

First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, don't let it go (What?)
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya (C'mon)
First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, don't let it go (C'mon)
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya

Ayo where my niggas at?

Give 'em love and they give it back
Talk too much for too long (What?)
Don't give up, you're too strong (What?)
Dog to the wow wow hunnies (Yeah!)
Shoutout to niggas that done it (C'mon!)
And it ain't even about the dough
It's about gettin' down for what you stand for, yo
