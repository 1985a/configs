Now the party's over
I'm so tired
Then I see you coming
Out of nowhere
Much communication in a motion
Without conversation or a notion
Avalon
When the samba takes you
Out of nowhere
And the background's fading
Out of focus
Yes the picture changing
Every moment
And your destination
You don't know it
Avalon
When you bossa nova
There's no holding
Would you have me dancing
Out of nowhere
Avalon
