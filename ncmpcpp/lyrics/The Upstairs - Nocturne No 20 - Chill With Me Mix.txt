Switch it up
Switch it up
Oh whoa
Yeah eh, Yeah
Let's go

I call my girl 'cause I got a problem
Only a curl is gonna solve it
Then I don't really care,
Just get him out of my hair, yeah
Let's switch it up, get it off my shoulder
I've had enough, can't take it no longer
I'm over him I swear,
I'm like yeah

Gotta get him out my hair [4x]

'Cause he was just a dick and I knew it
Got me going mad sitting in this chair
Like I don't care
Gotta get him out my hair
I tried everything but it's useless
He pushed me so far. Now I'm on the edge
Make him disappear
Go get him out my hair

Okay, gotta bleach him out, peroxide on him
Hair on the floor like my memory of him
Now I feel brand new,
This chick is over you
We're going out, ain't got no worries
Drama now, now it just seems so funny
Put my hands up in the air,
I'm like yeah

Gotta get him out my hair [4x]

'Cause he was just a dick and I knew it
Got me going mad sitting in this chair
Like I don't care
Gotta get him out my hair
I tried everything but it's useless
He pushed me so far. Now I'm on the edge
Make him disappear
Go get him out my hair

Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da-da,
Switch it up, switch it up
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, oh
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da-da,
Switch it up, switch it up
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, oh

Friend you need to get your phone, erase that number
Don't call him back 'cause he don't deserve that
And when you see him in the club
Just flip your hair, don't show him any love
'Cause you've had enough

'Cause he was just a dick and I knew it
Got me going mad sitting in this chair
Like I don't care
Gotta get him out my hair
I tried everything but it's useless
He pushed me so far. Now I'm on the edge
Make him disappear
Go get him out my hair

Go get him out my hair
He's in my hair
Gonna get him out
Gonna get him out
(Got to get him out my hair)
