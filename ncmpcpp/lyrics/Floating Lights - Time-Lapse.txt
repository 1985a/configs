[Mandy Moore]
All those days watching from the windows
All those years outside looking in
All that time never even knowing
Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here suddenly I see
Standing here it's all so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be

[Mandy Moore]
And at last I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything looks different
Now that I see you

[Zachary Levi]
All those days chasing down a daydream
All those years living in a blur
All that time never truly seeing
Things, the way they were
Now she's here shining in the starlight
Now she's here suddenly I know
If she's here it's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go

[Both]
And at last I see the light

[Zachary Levi]
And it's like the fog has lifted

[Both]
And at last I see the light

[Mandy Moore]
And it's like the sky is new

[Both]
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything is different
Now that I see you

Now that I see you
