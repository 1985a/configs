Inï»¿ the s***e of the heart is a place of no FEAR!

Fear is the mind killer.

A feeling without limits that you cannot ENGINEER!

Fear is the mind killer.

Whoever said we're not supposed to get ECSTATIC?

Fear is the mind killer.

It's a media-induced comatose ANAESTHETIC!

Fear is the mind killer.

I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain
