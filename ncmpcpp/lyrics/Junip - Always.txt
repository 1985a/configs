Droning chords and distant bells
Humming over empty shells
Holding on tight onto a dead sky

Nomadic moves across a lawn
Inch by inch into the dawn
Holding on tight onto a dead sky

Turn a deaf ear no matter what they might say
Always
Turn a deaf ear pushing you further away
Always

Droning chords and distant bells
To what's been over since the fall
Holding tight to what's been felt
Holding on tight onto a dead sky

Turn a deaf ear no matter what they might say
Always
Turn a deaf ear pushing you further away
Always
