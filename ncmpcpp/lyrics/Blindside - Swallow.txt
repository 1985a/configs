Been waiting and now you're sinking slow
Been watching how you rated me low
You say water is supposed to be brown
I say there's garbage in the fountain

Taste and swallow down

Been wanted for thinking slow
You've been longing for an open window
So get out throw out
You're thirsty no doubt
But you have to taste and swallow down
