It starts in my belly
Then up to my heart
Into my mouth I can't keep it shut
Do you recognise the smell
Is that how you tell
Us apart
I fool myself
To sleep and dream
Nobody's there
No-one but me
So cool
You're hardly there
Why can't this be killing you
Frankenstein would want your mind
Your lovely head
Your lovely head
