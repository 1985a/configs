I know I'm dead before my time
I know it's coming down
If you could only see what's right
You'd see what's coming 'round

So I walk alone
I ask no quarter friend
I walk alone
Till I find you again

I know no place to call my bed
But I know this thorny crown
If you would only feed your head
You'd see your hands are bound

So I walk alone
I ask no quarter friend
I walk alone
Till I find you again
