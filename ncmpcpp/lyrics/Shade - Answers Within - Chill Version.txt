Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

You got me looking, so crazy my baby
I'm not myself lately I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
Baby your love's got the best of me
Your love's got the best of me
Baby your love's got the best of me
Baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
Cause baby you got me, you got me, oh you got me, you got me

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
And I still don't understand
Just how your love could do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your love)

Hoping you'll save me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (your love)
Looking so crazy in love
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now

Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (your love)
Looking so crazy in love
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
