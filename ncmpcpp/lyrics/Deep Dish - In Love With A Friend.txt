I'm in love with a friend 
Going on a week 
I'm in love with a friend 
I can hardly speak 

I can read between the lines 
And I can read between the sheets 
In my passion you will find 
My face is red as beet... 'cause 

I'm in love with a friend 
I don't know what to do 
I'm in love with a friend 
And that friend is you 

Be surprised by my remark 
For they surprised me too 
If I weren't shooting in the dark 
I'd be as confused as you 
But I'm in love 

All that you've told me 
All that we've been through 
If we end up together 
What would my friends say to you? 

I'm in love with a friend 
I don't know what to do 
I'm in love with a friend 
And that friend is you 

Be surprised by my remark 
For they surprised me too 
If I weren't shooting in the dark 
I'd be as confused as you 
But I'm in love
