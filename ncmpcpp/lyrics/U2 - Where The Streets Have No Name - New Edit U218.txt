I want to run
 want to hide
 want to tear down the walls
        
         
         That hold me inside
 want to reach out
 
         
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name


I want to feel sunlight on my face
I see the dust cloud disappear 
Without a trace
I want to take shelter from the poison rain
Where the streets have no name


Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building 
Then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do


The city's aflood
And our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in dust
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain
Where the streets have no name


Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building
Then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do
Our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh, and I see love
See our love turn to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh, when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do
