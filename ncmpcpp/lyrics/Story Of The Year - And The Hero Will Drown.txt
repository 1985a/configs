The night will come and rip away
Her wings of innocence through every word we say
Maybe it's time to spit out the core
Of our rotting union hopefully before it chokes us to our senses

I guess it's too bad that everything we have is taken away

Swim in the smoke
The hero will drown
Intoxicating beauty tears everything down
But still our hands are bound at the wrists
This romantic tragedy is suffocating from your fist in a sea of fire

I guess it's too bad that everything we have is taken away
I guess it's too bad that everything we have is taken away

Hero hero
This word you'll never know
Hero hero
This word you'll never know
You'll never know

I guess it's too bad that everything we have is taken away
I guess it's too bad that everything we have is taken away
I guess it's too bad that everything we have is taken away
I guess it's too bad that everything we have is taken away

Away, away, away, they're taking it away
Away, away, they're taking it away
