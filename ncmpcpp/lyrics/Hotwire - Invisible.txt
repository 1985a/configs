I remember when everything was calm
Now I'm thinking about chaos, chaos
I'm not dead
I'm not alive
I've got something that's on my mind
I said...
"We're on our way to a better place
We're on our way to nowhere safe"

It's all right if you don't care about being

Invisible
Everyone wants to be
Invisible
To hide, to hide, to hide

I got a problem that's never ending
No, I wear a sign that says,
"Stay off, stay off!"
I'm not low
I'm always high
I got nothing that's in my mind
They said...
"We can't explain a single thing
I can't erase the shame you bring"

Well, it's all right if you don't care about being

Invisible
Everyone wants to be
Invisible
To hide, to hide, to hide
Invisible
Everyone wants to be
Invisible
To hide, to hide...so

Death has won so sell us
We got nothing left
Come on now sell us
We got nothing left
Lets die 'cause we know
We know death has won
It's never too late for our graves
And I'm too lame
For this way

It's all right if you don't care
I've already been prepared
It's all right if you don't care about being

Invisible
Everyone wants to be
Invisible
To hide, to hide, to hide
Invisible
Everyone wants to be
Invisible
To hide, to hide
