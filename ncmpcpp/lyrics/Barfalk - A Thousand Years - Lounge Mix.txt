 Heart beats fast
 Colors and promises
 How do be brave
 How can I love when I'm afraid
 To fall
 But watching you stand alone
 All of my doubt
 Suddenly goes away somehow

 (Pre-)
 One step closer

 ()
 I have died everyday
 waiting for you
 Darling, don't be afraid
 I have loved you for a
 Thousand years
 I'll love you for a
 Thousand more

 (2)
 Time stands still
 Beauty in all she is
 I will be brave
 I will not let anything
 Take away
 What's standing in front of me
 Every breath,
 Every hour has come to this

 (Pre-)
 One step closer

 ()
 I have died everyday
 Waiting for you
 Darling, don't be afraid
 I have loved you for a
 Thousand years
 I'll love you for a
 Thousand more

 And all along I believed
 I would find you
 Time has brought
 Your heart to me
 I have loved you for a
 Thousand years
 I'll love you for a
 Thousand more

 (Pre-x2)
 One step closer

 One step closer

 I have died everyday
 Waiting for you
 Darling, don't be afraid,
 I have loved you for a
 Thousand years
 I'll love you for a
 Thousand more

 And all along I believed
 I would find you
 Time has brought
 Your heart to me
 I have loved you for a
 Thousand years
 I'll love you for a
 Thousand more
