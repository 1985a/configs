You mean the world to me
(and I am weightless)
Your heart is everything
(and I am useless)

If you only ask me kindly
I will not come undone

I'll go alone to find you
I did not try to love you
Because I'm sorry I am me

What do you want me to be?
(I'm so ugly)
Please don't be angry with me
(I'm not complete)

If you confess
I will depress
I will not fuck with you

I'll go alone to find you
I did not try to love you
Because I'm sorry I am me

Easily, you are to me, I should have been around
Easily, you are to me, I should have been around
