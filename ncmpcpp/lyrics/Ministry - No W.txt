If this is really living
Then why am I so unforgiving
Half the world is down the toilet
Half is on its way

Well if I had a dollar for
Every time he hollers:
"Trust us with your hearts and minds"
Or I'll make you pay

TRUST ME

Ask me why you're feeling screwed
And I'll give you an answer
There's a Colin, Dick and Bush
Just a-hammerin' away

Ask me why you feel deceived
And stripped of all your liberties
It doesn't take a genius
To explain that today

TRUST ME
