R'rraahhh!...
Go!... So fucking determined, yeah, yeah!
Go!... You better believe it... Confidence!
Go!... So fucking determined, yeah, yeah!
Go!... Spit out all reason, yeah!

I'm tired of holdin' up the weight,
The weight of the mother fucking world
All I want is to just get right here, right now

We struggle and fight just to get in -
-the grave that's overflowing
Clock's ticking on my 15 minutes of fame

Come on, now... 1, 2, 3...
Go!... So fucking determined, yeah, yeah!
Go!... You better believe it... Confidence!
Go!... So fucking determined, yeah, yeah!
Go!... Spit out all reason, yeah!

I'm flushing the trust of everyone stabbing -
-in the back and thinking they can break me
Set my sight, can't die 'til I'm done... My endurance

Never wanted anymore than what I deserve
Better bring it, I'm taking it all
Fuck an inch, 'cause I'm bringin' a mile

It's on, now... 1, 2, 3...
Go!... So fucking determined, yeah, yeah!
Go!... You better believe it... Confidence!
Go!... So fucking determined, yeah, yeah!
Go!... Spit out all reason, yeah!

This fire, is growing, is burning deep inside of me
Focused, driven, certain... The way it's gotta' be
Fire, growing, burning deep inside of me 
Focused, driven, certain... The way it's gotta' be
Crooked, no trust, liars... Conmen drunk w/ power 
Mentor taught me everything that I know!
So wrong!... Wrong!... Wrong!... Wrong!

1, 2, 3...
Go!... So fucking determined, yeah, yeah!
Go!... You better believe it... Confidence!
Go!... So fucking determined, yeah, yeah!
Go!... Spit out all reason, yeah!

Go!... I'm fucking determined, yeah, yeah!
Go!... You better believe it... Confidence!
Go!... I'm fucking determined, yeah, yeah!
Go!... Spit out all reason, yeah!
