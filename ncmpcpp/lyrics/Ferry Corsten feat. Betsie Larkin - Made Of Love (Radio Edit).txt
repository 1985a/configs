[Verse 1:]
Just try to break me
Take everything away
Just try to shake me
Out of my placeNothing's created
And nothing is destro~oyed[Verse 2:]
Just try to tame me
You'll never find a way
There's no containing
A moment to brakeNothing's created
And nothing is destro~oyed[Chorus :]
Take it away
I'll never give this up (No way to break)
Throw it away
We're all made of love (There isn't a way)
We're all made of love[Verse 3:]
Just try to save me
There's nothing you can change
There's no explaining
And no one to blameNothing's created
And nothing can destro~oyNever give this up
We're all made of love
We're all made of love[Chorus :]
Take it away
I'll never give this up (No way to break)
Throw it away
We're all made of love (There isn't a way)
We're all made of loveTake it away
I'll never give this up (No way to break)
Throw it away
We're all made of love (There isn't a way)
We're all made of loveI'll never give this up
We're all made of love
We're all made of love
