Little Suzie's crusin for some love and affection
Arm in arm with everyone been charmin' the nation

Cindy picks the wallets for her friends medications
Willin' patient Julie sittin' waits for attention

Lucy's got a uniform for every occasion
Annie's got a gun she says she stole for protection
As someone in the background screams another objection
Sally turns her back and walks in dissatisfaction

Rudi's got a problem he's got too much aggression
Disregardin' everything it's time for detention
He's got Bobby in a bottle, he's got Billy in a stetson
He's got Betty does her best but it's a bad situation

Gina's getting' God so she can get up to heaven
Lookin' like an angel in the name of salvation
Cathy's in a coma that she calls meditation
As Danny does the devil now he's down for damnation

Jim's tryin' hard to learn from every lesson
Lookin' to the future and some great expectation
Nikki's countin' days 'till she inherits the mansion
And all the boys are waitin' for a piece of the action

Simon says and Simon does what nobody mentions
Peter's getting restless lacking all true expression
Tommy's undecided he can't make no decisions
As Joni's in the basement getting bored the tension
