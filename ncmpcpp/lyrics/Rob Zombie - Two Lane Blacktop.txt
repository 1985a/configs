We've been goin', I'v never been at ease
I met a gyspie girl and took her on the track
The kinda girl walk
The driver don't talk
20 bucks between them just to keep them alive

Drivin'
Drivin'
Drivin'
Blacktop rollin'

Were goin', goin' to Amrillo
A zero to a sixty, in a 7.5
A model and a bagel steels California
A glass of a beer, a scot of a rat

Come on!

Come on baby, I ain't crazy
Come on baby, pick me up, pick me up!
Come on baby, do me baby
Come on baby, hook it up, hook it up!

Blacktop rollin'

Where ya goin', an airport road
A clean machine, a real home girl
Baracuda, '68
Nothing there, she can wait
