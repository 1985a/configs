From Alpha to Omega
No Ones greater
While your cutting the wax
And cross up the fader
You can cross the fade
But can't fade the cross
Divine blood drops
Can set free the lost
Love personified
Makes seas divide
Eyes of the storm
Of the tempest ride
Who can compare
Who can dare to stare in the eyes of the Most High and die

Often imitated
Never duplicated
Only One original
Underrated
Perfect in ways in which we could be
Others like Him
Never will be

Ancient of Days
In mysterious ways
Works wonders
Setting bushes a blaze
40 years in a maze
With a pillar of fire
Dancing on waves
My life's desire
Who is like You
Who was, is and will be
Who can do what You can do simply?
He who has an ear, let him hear
Speaking through the speaker to your ears
Is my transmission clear?
