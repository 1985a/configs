I was stupid, really stupid.
Something told me deep inside better not do it.
What a dummy, such a dummy
To let some mess I shouldn't did take you from me.
Girl if I could take it back
It'd be so back.
I'd be such an angel,
You'd think that me and Jesus was cool
Like that, just like that,
Everything between us be good.

Girl I know what I should have done.
Should have walked away the moment that I saw her coming
But I blew it, really blew it
And lost the only girl I love.

Dear God if you're listening now
I need you do a thing for me.
You see my baby, she done up and walked out
I need you bring her back to me.
I know that I was wrong, I was guilty as sin
Probably not priority
But dear God if you're listening now
Down here
Dying
Begging
Crying
Somebody need to pray for me

(Mmhm) [x3]
Dear God if you're listening
(Mmhm) [x3]

Thought I was something, really something
In the end, who knew I'd end up with nothing?
I was fronting, truly fronting
Girl I really can't be mad I had it coming
Guess if I was half the man I know I am
I would be so good that even Oprah be jealous of you
It's like that, yeah, like that
Everything between us be good

Girl I know what I should have done.
Should have walked away the moment that I saw her coming
But I blew it, really blew it
And lost the only girl I love

Dear God if you're listening now
I need you do a thing for me.
You see my baby, she done up and walked out
I need you bring her back to me.
I know that I was wrong, I was guilty in sin
Probably not priority
But dear God if you're listening now
I'm down here
Dying
Begging
Crying
Somebody oughta pray for me

I'm making you this promise right now
If you can do this one thing for me
I'll be the man that you want
I'll be the man that you need
Church every Sunday
Prayers every Monday
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
Just bring my baby back to me.

Dear God if you're listening now
