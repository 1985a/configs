It's time to begin,
Start out over again,
What you is, what you been,
Forget everything.

All the love that you made,
All the joy and the pain,
All the anger and hate,
Rewind and erase.

Protect and survive,
You're better alive,
Take a step to the side,
Relax and revive.

It's easy to change,
Go out and get a new name,
Forget yesterday.

Tap your troubles away.

Tap your troubles away. Tap your troubles away.
