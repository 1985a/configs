Since you've gone
Nothing seems to fit no more
Nothing's as it was before

Everyday
Is a battle that I just can't win
I know I won't see you again

But I keep waiting for the night
I close my eyes and hope you'll find me sleeping

'cause in my dreams
We can spend a little time just talking
In my dreams
We're side by side just walking

Oh, I think of the times we used to know
The places we used to go
Are still there
In my dreams
On the front of the crossbar of your bike
We can go anyplace, anywhere you like
In my dreams

And as hard as it seems
'Til then I'll wait
To see you again
In my dreams

Don't you wake me up
I don't wanna go nowhere
I've been waiting for a zillion years

You're gone too soon
I know I'll never get the chance
To say the things I never said

But I keep waiting for the night
I close my eyes and hope you'll find me sleeping

'cause in my dreams
We can spend a little time together
In my dreams
We're side by side just walking

Oh by the pier that we used to know
The places we used to go
Are all still there
In my dreams
On the front of the crossbar of your bike
We can go any place, anywhere we like
In my dreams

And some place when i feel we'll fade away
'Til then I'll wait
To see you again
In my dreams, again
'cause I'll wait, I'll wait
To see you again
In my dreams

I'll see you again
In my dreams
