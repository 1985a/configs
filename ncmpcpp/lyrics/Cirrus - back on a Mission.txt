Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to throw down

It's a ratatatatt on the nucleus of your brain cell
came to rock the funky joint so I might as well
Get on the one
And have some fun
And drop a break in the barrel of my shotgun
Boom like a bolt of lightning goes my shotgun
I pass the mic to cause I like to
Back on a mission and ready to ride
If we dont get you now gonna get you on the b-side

Coming at you live monophonic lo-fi
Were cutting up rugs where the beats will never die
In it to win it no matter how skin it
No holdin back loading breaks to the finish
Boom like a bolt of lightning goes my shotgun
I pass the mic to cause I like to
Back on a mission and ready to ride
If we dont get you now gonna get you on the b-side

My mission is to invade your mind
And you better believe you're gonna like my kind
Strange voices in my head
Freedom is what they said

(Repeat from the beginning)

Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to throw down...
