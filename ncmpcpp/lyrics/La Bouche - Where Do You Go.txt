Where do you go, my lovely 
Where do you go 
I want to know, my lovely 
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh 
Where do you, where do you go 
Where do you, where do you go 

My imagination drives me insane 
Tell me what's the game you play 
Never in my life did I feel such a pain 
You don't need to hide away 

Where do you go, my lovely 
Where do you go 
I want to know, my lovely 
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh 
Where do you, where do you go 
Where do you, where do you go 

Where do you, where do you go 

Everytime I call you're not home what is wrong 
Can it be you're really mean 
If you're hanging 'round every night until dawn 
And I wonder where you've been 

Where do you go, my lovely 
Where do you go 
I want to know, my lovely 
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh 
Where do you, where do you go 
Where do you, where do you go 

Where do you go, my lovely 
Where do you go 
I want to know, my lovely 
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh
I want to know, oh-oh-ay-oh 
Where do you, where do you go 
Where do you, where do you go
