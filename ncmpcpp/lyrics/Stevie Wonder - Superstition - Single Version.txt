Very superstitious, writings on the wall, 
Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall, 
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass 
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past

When you believe in things that you don't understand, 
Then you suffer, 
Superstition ain't the way 

Very superstitious, wash your face and hands, 
Rid me of the problem, do all that you can, 
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong, 
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song 

When you believe in things that you don't understand, 
Then you suffer, 
Superstition ain't the way, yeh, yeh 

Very superstitious, nothin' more to say, 
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way, 
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass, 
Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past 

When you believe in things that you don't understand, 
Then you suffer, Superstition ain't the way, no, no, no
