[Chorus:]Watching every motion in my foolish lover's gameOn this endless ocean finally lovers know no shame         
         
         Turning and returning to some secret place insideWatching in slow motion as you turn around and say  
         

Take my breath away [Repeat: x1]

Watching I keep waiting still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place to hide
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say

Take my breath away

Through the hourglass I saw you, in time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you, and turned to hear you say
If only for today I am unafraid

Take my breath away [Repeat: x1]

[Chorus]
Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say

Take my breath away
My love, take my breath away...
