Intro
The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl, the way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines, divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, i could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned, feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl i could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

Verse 1
I never knew but I was walking the line
Come go with me, I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
My baby cried, she left me standing alone

Chorus
She's so dangerous, the girl is so dangerous
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey but you're no damn good for me

Interlude
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss, a whisper of love
I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's, strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

Verse 2
I never knew but I was living in vain
She called my house, she said you know my name
And don't you pretend you never did me before
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door

Chorus
She's so dangerous, the girl is so dangerous
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey but you're no damn good for me

Dangerous, the girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God
'Cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover friend of mine

Verse 3
I can not sleep alone tonight
My baby left me here tonight
I can not cope till it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby

Interlude
And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman, drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it 'cause it's dangerous

Chorus
She's so dangerous, the girl is so dangerous
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey but you're no damn good for me

She's so dangerous, the girl is so dangerous
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey but you're no damn good for me

She's so dangerous, the girl is so dangerous
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey but you're no damn good for me

Dangerous, the girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God
'Cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover friend of mine
