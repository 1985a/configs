Centred photo lines capture the sentimental waves
And we all take our places to reconcile all the faces outside the frame
Is this camouflage or just some dream
To atone our sins and watch them fall to their knees

I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough

And how will I know enough
How will I know enough to call it to me
Cause I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to feel the trouble that surrounds me
I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to know the trouble that surrounds me

We are paralysed in what beckons us to bleed
Harboured in our dusty heads lie the complete works of revolutions unseen
Harboured in our dusty heads lie works of revolution
Are we camouflaged or in some dream
To atone our sin brigades and watch them fall to, fall to their knees

I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to feel the trouble that surrounds me
I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to know the trouble that surrounds me

And where is awake enough to find some peace
And how will I know enough
How will I know enough to call it to me
Cause I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to feel the trouble that surrounds me
I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to know the trouble that surrounds me
I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to bear the trouble that surrounds me
I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to feel the trouble that surrounds me
I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to bear the trouble that surrounds me
I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to feel the trouble that surrounds me
