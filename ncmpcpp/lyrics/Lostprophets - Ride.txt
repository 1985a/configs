With you it's never good enough 
Because you want the stuff that could change your future 
You're lost amongst a sea of chance 
And now the more you dance just gets you SINKING deeper 
It's ok, dont appologize 
You dont know what you're striving for and you never seem to try 
It's too early, go live your lie
Keep on moving, it's time to... 

Ride, ride, ride, now it's time to... 
Ride, ride, ride 

Everything seems tempting but nothing comes for free 
I often wonder how you drive when the road's too dark to see 
It's too early, It's time to... 

Ride, ride, ride 

We light the fire to watch it burn 
But when it comes your turn all that's left is embers 
You ran this race with no real heart, you're right back at the start 
You'd already lost it 
It's ok, dont appologize 
You dont know what you're striving for and you never seem to try 
It's too early, go live your lie
Keep on moving, it's time to... 

Ride, ride, ride, now its time to... 
Ride, ride, ride 

Everything seems tempting but nothing comes for free 
I often wonder how you drive when the road's too dark to see 
It's too early, It's time to... 

Ride, ride, ride 

Everything feels tempting when you dont know who to be 
I often wonder how you feel when you're lying next to me 
It's too early, it's time to... 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, so what? 
Yeah, yeah, after all that time 
Yeah, yeah, no answers 

Ride, ride 

You know it's not enough 
You know it's not enough 
You know it's not enough
