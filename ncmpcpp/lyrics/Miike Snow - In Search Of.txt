Yes, I've been living long enough to be
Forgiven
For the bones I broke I had to make
A living (a living)

But we won't back down from anything
In search of a remedy
No we won't back down from anything
In search of a remedy

Father put his foot down on my games
Forever
So in the marketplace I stay calm
And clever

And we won't back down from anything
In search of a remedy

No we won't back down from anything
In search of a remedy
