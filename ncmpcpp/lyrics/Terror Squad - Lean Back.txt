Ow, yeah, my niggas
Throw ya hands in the air right now man 
Feel this shit right here
Yeah, oh

I don't give a fuck 'bout your fault or mishappenin's
Nigga, we from the Bronx, New York, shit happens
Kids clappin' love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the Squad got a scar on they face

It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga this is life
Got the phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave.
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad

As a youngin', I was too much to cope with
Why you think, mo'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Cokeshit
Should've been called Don Robbery
Extortion or maybe Grand Larceny

I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate, no I didn't flow Joe shit
Fat nigga with shotty was the logo kid

Said my niggas don't dance
Ee just pull up the pants and
Do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

I said my niggas don't dance
See we just pull up the pants and
Do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

R to the E'zzy, M to the whizz-i
My arms stay breezy,  the Don's stay fizz-i
Got a date at eight, the day I was in the 740 fizz-i
And I just bought a bike so I can ride till I die

With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So nevermind how we got in here with the burners and hoodies

Listen, we don't pay admission and bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't no need for a VIP section
In the middle of the dance floor, reckless, check it, said it

Like my necklace, started relaxin'
Now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thing nigga, we still the same nigga
Flows just changed now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up the pants and
Do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up the pants and
Do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back, c'mon

Now we livin' better now, Gucci sweater now
And that G4 could fly through any weather now
See niggas get tight, when you worth some millions
That's why I sport the chinchilla to hurt their feelings

You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out at Vegas front row on all the fights and shit
If I visited Compton, they'd prolly squeal
'Cause half these rappers did blow like Derrick Forreal

If you cross the line, damn right, I'm gon' hurt you
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up

Kay keep tellin' me to speak about Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship

My niggas don't dance
We just pull up the pants and
Do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up the pants and
Do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back, c'mon

Huh, yeah
Terror Squad, huh
Big Pun forever, yeah
Streets is ours
It ain't never gonna stop
Search, Raoul, J-B Fathead, c'mon
