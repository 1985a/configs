Every day I wake up
I hope I'm dreaming
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's hard to just keep going
It's like I feel empty inside without you being here

I would do anything, man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit up, shit don't mean nothin'
I saw your son today
He look just like you
You was the greatest
You'll always be the greatest
I miss you, Big
Can't wait till that day when I see your face again
I can't wait till that day when I see your face again

Yeah, this right here goes out to
Everyone who's lost someone that they truly loved
Check it out

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family I'll fulfill your dreams

In the future can't wait to see 
If you'll open up the gates for me
Reminisce sometime the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you

Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you

We miss you, Big

It's kinda hard wit' you not around
Know you in Heaven smilin' down
Watching us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
Till the day we meet again
In my heart is where I keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe

My thoughts, Big, I just can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us and the six shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they received you on
Still can't believe you're gone
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make (I'll miss you)
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Thinking of the day
When you went away (you)
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you (somebody tell me why)

On that morning
When this life is over
I know, I'll see your face

Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
