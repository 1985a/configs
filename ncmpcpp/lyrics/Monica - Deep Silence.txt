No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
o, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
         
         
         Whatever you got I can get it
magine got key to the city
 
         
Look at this house that we live in
Together we're always right
You know you the one on my mid
'Cause your hustle is always right
Oh, I can't believe the magic we make
Together we're always right

Oh, this isn't made up, oh no
Everyone's searching for a love like us, baby
The power we make up
Is the best ??? for us

I think I'm going deep, so, so deep in love
I think I'm going deep, boy you're going deep
Deep, deep, deep in love
'Cause no one had ever told me
That together we'd be one
I think I'm going deep, deep, deep, deep
So deep in love
Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep
Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep

I know they gonna ask how I did it
And just found ??? got a ring on my finger
I turned him to a believer
Good woman can change your life, oho
Together we keeping our balance
But saying the things that matter
And still I be up in that kitchen after you practice
Cooking you all of your favorite things
You got a taste for your favorite
But we got nothing to play with

Oh, this isn't made up, oh no
Everyone's searching for a love like us, baby
The power we make up
Is the best ??? for us

I think I'm going deep, so, so deep in love
I think I'm going deep, boy you're going deep
Deep, deep, deep in love
'Cause no one had ever told me
That together we'd be one
I think I'm going deep, deep, deep, deep
So deep in love
Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep
Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep
