You can't feel your heart beating 
When you're staring at it on the ground 
You can hardly even see it through the ashes all around 
You can't run like your free when 
You can't give up what's got you down 
What if you can find healing if you let me in somehow 
But trust don't come easy oh oh 
It's never easy if you don't know 
Just don't stop believing oh oh oh 

[Chorus:]
If you fall I'll catch you 
If the world comes at you 
You can always run to me 
I'll be your hiding place 
And if the stars burn out of the sky 
And your heart lost it's light, just never let me go 
And I'll scare your fears away 
Yeah I'll be your hiding place 

You don't have to live bleeding 
Who says you gotta carry all that weight 
I'll be everything you need yeah your rescues on it's way 
Trust don't come easy oh oh 
It's never easy if you don't know
 
[Chorus]
 
And I won't let you go 
You gotta lay it on the line to know 
You don't have to do it on your own 

[Chorus]

Oh
Yeah, I'll scare all of your fears away 
I'll be your hiding place
