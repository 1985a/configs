[Lil Mo](Ja Rule){Vita}
Where would I be
Without you baby
So if you need me
If you want me to put it on you
Because I love ya- yeah
And don't you forget it
Whenever you need me
If you want me to put it on you, come on
Oh, oh, oh

Whoa, whoa, oh
(Where would I be without you)
Baby, without you

[Ja Rule](Lil' Mo)
Where would I be without my baby (baby)
The thought alone might break me (ooh)
And I don't wanna go crazy
Cuz every thug needs a lady
(Yeah, yeah)

Girl it feel like you and I been mourning together
Inseparable, we chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a part of me
Mind body and soul ain't no I in we baby
(No, no)
When you cry who wipes yo tears (you)
When you scared, who's tellin you there's nothin to fear
(you, you, you, you)
Girl I'll always be there
When you need a shoulder to lean on
Never hesitate knowin' you can call on, your soul-mate
And vice versa, dats why I be the firsta
See Jacob and frost your wrist up
Now you owe me, I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me

Where would I be without you
(Where would I be without you)
I only think about you
(if what you're saying is true)
I know you're tired of being lonely
(I need someone to hold me)
So baby girl put it on me
(I will, I will, I will)
Where would I be without you

I only think about you
(if what you're saying is true)
I know you're tired of being lonely
(I need you to hold me)
So baby girl put it on me
(Whoa, whoa)

[Vita](Lil' Mo)
Yo, and I appreciate the rocks
and gifts that you cop me baby (ooh)
And that house on the hill when you drop like 80 (yeah)
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy we been down since junior high
So when life get as hot July it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and ever
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely (lonely)
So baby boy put it on me

[Ja Rule](Lil' Mo)

Where would I be without you
