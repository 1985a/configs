Days,
You always want to tell me lies.
You try to sell me to the stars at night
You think I'm too uptight

Love,
You call me on the phone, alone
You wish that I could stay
Speaking pain in codes

Telling me you still care through a dial tone

Drugs,
You want to put my life on hold
You really want to see me growing old with you
Like a naive friend

But I,
I never wanna face myself again
Unless I'm coming true
Speaking pain in codes

I'm Telling you that I know I'm no good alone

And I've tried so hard just to be myself
But I've erased everything I was
I tried searching for the truth alone
And I remember everything I've done

I'm thinking everything will turn out fine
But I'm a little kid without a soul
Give me just a little bit more time
Just a little bit

Say, what you want to do to me or you
I don't care
Right?

Yeah

And I've tried so hard just to be myself
But I've erased everything I was
I tried searching for the truth alone
And I remember everything I've done

And I've erased everything I know
And I'm a little kid without a soul
Give me just a little bit more time
To solve my future, to solve my future
