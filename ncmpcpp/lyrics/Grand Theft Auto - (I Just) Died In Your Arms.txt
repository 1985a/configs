Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
whoa, whoa

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary, it sits on the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cat's in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this
whoa, whoa

Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Whoa, whoa
Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away, I should've walked away

Is there any just cause for feeling like this
On the surface I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then I screwed up again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times

Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said,
Whoa, whoa
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away

It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over, the moment is gone
I followed my hands, not my head,
I know I was wrong

Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said,
I just died tonight
Whoa, whoa
Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
I should should should've walked I should've walked away
