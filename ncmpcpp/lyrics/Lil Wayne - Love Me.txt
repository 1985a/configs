I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
Imma ball till the day I fall
Ball, ball, ball, ball

Lil Wayne:
Pussy-ass niggas stop hatin'
Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these hoes love me like Satan, man...
Yeah,

Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick
She's on a strict diet
That's my baby

With no make-up, she a ten
And she the best with the head
Even better than Corinne
She don't want money

She want the time we could spend
She said "'Cause I really need somebody,
So tell me you're that somebody."

And girl, I fuck who I want
And fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit
At that Filet Mignon

She say "I never wanna you make you mad,
I just wanna make you proud."
I say "Baby, just make me cum,
Then don't make a sound."

Lil Wayne:
Real niggas, fuck these haters
These hoes got pussies like craters
Can't treat these hoes like ladies, man...

Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She say my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name tastes like sardines
To these niggas

She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed
69, 96
I feel her heartbeat

I chest to chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down,
I'm arresting this bitch

Yeah, all my bitches love me
And I love all my bitches
But it's like soon as I cum
I come to my senses

And I would say these hoes' names
But then I would be snitchin'
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges
