If you wanna hang out you've got to take her out.
Cocaine.
If you wanna get down, down on the ground.
Cocaine.

[Chorus:]
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie;
Cocaine.

If you got bad news, you wanna kick them blues.
Cocaine.
When your day is done and you wanna run.
Cocaine.

[Chorus]

If your thing is gone and you wanna ride on.
Cocaine.
Don't forget this fact, you can't get it back.
Cocaine.

[Chorus 2x]
