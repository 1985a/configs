Unless my memories fade,
Unless my memories fade,
Wasn't that long ago.
Wasn't that long ago.
Came out 'Regulate'
Ain't no fun if your girl don't go.

And I love to love ya babe.
Love to love ya.
Love to love ya.
(ya ya ya ya ya ya)

I'm on the team cause I'm a playa.
Team cause I'm a playa.
And you can't fit in this....no
Oh no. Now now now now.

I want you all up on da floor so go'on and get on your feet.
I wanna know what you about, I wanna take you with me.
Girl, as long as you wit me, see, you can be who you be.
I want you all to understand that I can never be beat.

woh oh, oh
Keep it coming.
Keep it coming.
Keep it coming.
Oh Yah.
Keep it coming.
Keep it coming.
Keep it coming.

Damn, I'm broke as a bum on side of da freeway
Singing hey Mr. DJ.
Gimme your replay.
So I can receive pay.
And live comfortably
Got women huntin' me.
Want'n my company.
Trying to pump me full of censored' flushed their level
Recognize the devil when he messin' with the rebel.
I'm more then metal,
Ready to bring it to em strong.
Drive straight n long,
Make sure my name lives on.
And lasts long,
Number one with every song.
Rock a mic'phone.
Even if my sight gone.
Man your wrong,
Say you was hot as me.
Better chance in the lottery.
Make a mockery.
If you ain't bringing it real.
Lacking the skill
Average run of the mill.
What ever you feel.
Homey we can handle this.
Get it on from the bricks back to Los Angeles.

Keep it coming.
We keep it going non stop y'all.
Keep it coming.
All the way to the top y'all.
Keep it coming.
We keep it going non stop y'all.
Keep it coming.
On Rob and Nate Dogg y'all.

I can't stop, no, not if I wanted to.
I'm going to the bat for you.
Be kicking up dust for you.
One on one oh I can roll yoho' through
And take it to the concrete too.
Leave you all black and blue.
