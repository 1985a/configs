Deary blossom, I've gone down to old rock bottom
Now I know the love in my heart was true...
Divine sorrow, I thank you for the joy that followed
Back then my friend, if only you knew

It is harder when you love beyond belief
But I'm a fool to let you go,
So this is for you my love

We will never 
We will never have a change of mind
We belong together

We will never 
We will never be the weary kind

We sing our sorrows away
We sing our sorrows away
We sing our sorrows away

Divine blessing
I wish I would have heard your lesson
Now I know your words were my only truth
I'm just venting, or maybe I'm done confessing
Back then my friend, if only you knew

It is harder when you love beyond belief
But I'm a fool to let you go,
So this is for you my love

We will never 
We will never have a change of mind
We belong together

We will never 
We will never be the weary kind

We sing our sorrows away
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ohhh

We can make it through judgement day
We won't go fading away
All I ever know must be heaven where you come from

We can make it through cloudy skies
By your side, I feel alive
All I ever know must be heaven where you come from
Yeah
