I've got hoes
I've got hoes, in different area codes (area, area codes... codes)

Now you thought I was a 7-7-0 and 4-0-4
I'm worldwide bitch, act like y'all don't know
It's the abominable hoe-man
Globe-trot international postman
Neighbor-dick dope man!

7-1-8's, 2-0-2's
I send small cities and states IOUs
9-0-1, matter fact 3-0-5
I'll jump off the G-4, we can meet outside!

So control your hormones and keep your drawers on
Till I close the door and I'm jumping your bones
3-1-2s, 3-1-3s, 2-1-5, 8-0-3s

Aah, read your whore-oscope and eat your whore d'oeuvres
10 on Pump 1, these hoes is self-serve
7-5-7, 4-1-0 my cell phone just overloads.

Now every day is a hoe-liday,
So stop the violence and put the 4-4 away, 
Skeet shoot a hoe today.
5-0-4, 9-7-2
7-1-3 watcha gon' do?

You checkin' up the scene, I'm checkin' a hoe tonight
With perpendicular vehicular homicide
3-1-4, 2-0-1
Too much green, too much fun

I bang cock in Bangkok
Can't stop, I turn and hit the same spot
Think not, I'm the thrilla in Manilla,
Schlong in Hong Kong
Pimp 'em like Bishop Magic Don Juan.
Man, after Henny with a coke and a smile
I just pick up the motherfuckin' phone and dial
I got my condoms in a big ass sack
I'm slingin' this dick like a New Jack, bi-atch!

Is it 'cause they like my gangsta walk? (Gansta walk)
Is it 'cause they like my gangsta talk? (Gangsta talk)
Is it 'cause they like my handsome face? (Handsome face)
is it 'cause they like my gangsta ways? (Gansta ways, ooh)

Whatever it is? 
They love it and they just won't let me be.
I handle my biz!
Don't rush me, just relax and let me be free.
Whenever I call?
Come running 2-1-2 and 2-1-3.
You know that I ball!
Stop frontin' or I call my substitute freaks.
