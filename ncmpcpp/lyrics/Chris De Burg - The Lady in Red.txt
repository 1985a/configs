I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance
Given half a chance

I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind

The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here

It's just you and me
It's where I wanna be
But I hardly know
This beauty by my side

I'll never forget
The way you look tonight

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
You were amazing

I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled
It took my breath away

I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
As I do tonight

The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here

It's just you and me
It's where I wanna be
But I hardly know
This beauty by my side

I'll never forget
The way you look tonight
I never will forget
The way you look tonight

The lady in red
The lady in red
The lady in red
My lady in red

I love you
