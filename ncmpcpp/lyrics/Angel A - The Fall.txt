I try to face the fight within
But it's over
I'm ready for the riot to begin
And surrender
I walked the path that led me to the end
Remember
I'm caught beneath with nothing left to give
Forever

When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever, forever

Grey skies will chase the light away
No longer
I fought the fight now only dark remains 
Forever
Divided I will stand
And I will let this end

When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever, forever

The sun begins to rise
And wash away the sky
The turning of the tide
Don't leave it all behind
And I will never say goodbye

When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever, forever
Forever, forever
