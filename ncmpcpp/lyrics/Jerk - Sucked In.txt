Deep inside
You every day
You do not know, I will not say
Your underground
Makes me ill
If I don't do it no one will

The simple plan
I have for you
Try to guess what I will do
I can see
What you mean
It's always harder than it seems

Don't blame yourself
For breaking me
'Cause you just went and set me free
Then I sat you down
And shut your mouth
And show you what I always see

There is a small
Place for you
Where all your hopes and dreams come true
You move around
My world at will
Watch out 'cause I'm coming to kill

You've been
Sucked in
Again and again and again and again
You've been
Sucked in
Again and again and again and again
You've been
Sucked in
Again and again and again and again
You've been
Sucked in
Again and again and again, so..

Motherfucker come and play
Come on then, come on then
Come on then, come on then
Motherfucker come and play
Come on then, come on then
Come on then, come on then
Motherfucker come and play

You've broken up
'Cause you're breaking down
And very soon you'll hit the ground
You pulled your stunt
Your time has passed
The world you made has kicked your ass

You've been
Sucked in
Again and again and again and again
You've been
Sucked in
Again and again and again and again
You've been
Sucked in
Again and again and again and again
You've been
Sucked in
Again and again and again and again

You've been sucked in again
You've been sucked in again
You've been sucked in again
You've been sucked in again and again and again
Sucked in again and again and again
Sucked in again and again and again
Sucked in again, again, again
