Just try to break me
Take everything away
Just try to shake me
Out of my place

Nothing's created
And nothing is destroyed

Just try to tame me
You'll never find a way
There's no containing
A moment to brake

Nothing's created
And nothing is destroyed

Take it away,
Never give this up
(Throw it away)
We're all made of love
(There isn't a way)
We're all made of love

Just try to save me
There's nothing you can change
There's no explaining
And no one to blame

Nothing's created
And nothing can destroy

Never give this up
We're all made of love
We're all made of love

Take it away
Never give this up
(Throw it away)
We're all made of love
(There isn't a way)
We're all made of love

Take it away
Never give this up
(Throw it away)
We're all made of love
(There isn't a way)
We're all made of love

Never give th√Øs up
We're all made of love
We're all made of love
