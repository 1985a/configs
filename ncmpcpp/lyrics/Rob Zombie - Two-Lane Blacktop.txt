We've been goin', I've never been at ease
I met a gyspie girl and took her on the track
Mechanic don't walk, the driver don't talk
20 bucks between them just to keep them alive

Drivin'
Drivin'
Drivin'
Blacktop rollin'

Were goin', goin' to Amarillo
A zero to a sixty, in a 7.5
A model and a bagel steals California
A glass of a beer, a shot of rye

Come on! Drivin'
Come on! Drivin'
Come on! Drivin'

Come on! Drivin'
Come on! Drivin'
Come on! Drivin'
Blacktop rollin'

Come on baby, I ain't crazy, come on baby
Pick me up, pick me up!
Come on baby, do me baby, come on baby
Hook it up, hook it up!

Come on!
Come on!
Come on!

Come on! Drivin'
Come on! Drivin'
Come on! Drivin'
Blacktop rollin'

Where ya goin', an airport road
A clean machine, a real home girl
Baracuda, '68
Nothing there, she can't wait

Come on! Drivin'
Come on! Drivin'
Come on! Drivin'

Come on! Drivin'
Come on! Drivin'
Come on! Drivin'
Blacktop rollin'

Come on baby, I ain't crazy, come on baby
Pick me up, pick me up!
Come on baby, do me baby, come on baby
Hook it up, hook it up!

Come on!
Come on!
Come on!

Come on! Drivin'
Come on! Drivin'
Come on! Drivin'
Blacktop rollin'
