Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre:
Yeah nigga, I'm still fuckin' with ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E.
'99 nigga (Guess who's back?)
Still, still doin' that shit, huh Dre? (Oh for show)
Yeah (Check me out)

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was the Chronic
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on things)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my gang
Still puffin' my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Uh uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (for show)
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (for life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thing
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre:
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl
(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)

I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl

Dr. Dre:
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed, I smoke till I sleep
Wake up in the AM compose a beat
I bring the fire till your soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drive-by's and AK-matics
Swap meets, sticky green and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D.R.E.

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether your coolin' on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
Still (hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on things)
Dr. Dre be the name, still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin' love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard
Barbecue's every day, drivin' fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

Snoop Dogg:
Right back up in ya motherfuckin' ass, nine-five plus four pennies
Add that shit up, D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some with your dog, no stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks
Some of that real sticky icky icky, ooh wee
Put it in the air, oh, you's a fool D.R.
