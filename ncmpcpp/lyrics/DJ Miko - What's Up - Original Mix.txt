W-o-r-d
We're coming up
K-k-k-k-keep it
Keep it coming up
So do your dance
Do your dance
Do your dance quick, mama
Come on, baby
Tell me what's the word
OW!
Woo!
Ah-hey!
Word up!
C'mon, c'mon!
Woo!

[Perrie]
Yo pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show you
So tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister and your mama, too
'Cause we're about to throw down
And you know just what to do

[Jade]
Wave your hands in the air
Like you don't care
Glide by the people
As they start to look and stare
Do your dance
Do your dance
Do your dance quick, mama
Come on, baby
Tell me what's the word

Word up
Everybody say
When you hear the call
You've got to get it underway
Word up
It's the code word
No matter where you say it
You know that you'll be heard

[Leigh-Anne]
All you sucker DJs
Who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason
And we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs
And act real cool (you ain't cool!)
But you've got to realize
That you're acting like fools

[Jesy]
Give us music
We can use it
We need to dance
We don't have the time
For psychological romance
No romance
No romance
No romance for me, mama
Come on, baby
Tell me what's the word

Word up
Everybody say
When you hear the call
You've got to get it underway
Word up
It's the code word
No matter where you say it
You know that you'll be heard

W-O-R-D up
W-O-R-D up
W-O-R-D up (Everybody say)
W-O-R-D up

W-O-R-D we're coming up
Dial "L" for low
K-k-k-keep it
Keep it coming up
So do your dance
Do your dance
Do your dance quick, mama
Come on, baby
Tell me what's the word
Word up
Yeah, yeah
Word up
Word up
Hey, hey

Word up
Everybody say
When you hear the call
You've got to get it underway, get it underway
Word up
It's the code word
No matter where you say it
You know that you'll be heard
