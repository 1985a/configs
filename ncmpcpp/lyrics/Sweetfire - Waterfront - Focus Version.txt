And that ain't gonna change
So go ahead and talk your talk
Cause I won't take the bait

And if my real ain't real enough

Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down
Just come and get it, let them say what they say
Cause I'm about to put them all away (wooooo)

Ain't no need to hold it back
Go head and talk your shit (heyyy)

I know you're hoping I'm looking back
But if my real ain't real enough
Then I don't know what is (yeah)
