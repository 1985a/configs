Today
You were far away
And I
Didn't ask you why
What could I say
I was far away
You just walked away
And I just watched you
What could I say

How close am I
To losing you

Tonight
You just close your eyes
And I just watch you
Slip away

How close am I
To losing you

Hey, are you awake, yeah, I'm right here
Well, can I ask you
About today

How close am I
To losing you
How close am I
To losing
