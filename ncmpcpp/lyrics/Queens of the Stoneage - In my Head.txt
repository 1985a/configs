It's the cruelest joke to play
I'm so high I run in place
Only a line we separate
So

I keep on playin' our favorite song
I turn it up, while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

You're the only thing I've got
That I can't seem to get enough
We collide for one embrace
So

I keep on playin' our favorite song
I turn it up, while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

I keep on playin' our favorite song
I turn it up, while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

My radio, I can't wait forever

I keep on playin' our favorite song
I turn it up, while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

I keep on playin' our favorite song
I turn it up, while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

I need it
I need it
I need it now
