I could watch you for a lifetime
You're my favorite movie
A thousand endings
You mean everything to me
I never know what's comin'
Forever fascinated
Hope you don't stop runnin' to me
'Cause I'll always be waitin'

You are my cinema
I could watch you forever
Action, thriller
I could watch you forever
You are my cinema
A Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema...

[x3:]
Get up, get down
Three steps down
My DJ gonna break it down

Get up, get down
Lose that sound
Drop the bass

My cinema

Stars spell out your name
Like in a science fiction drama
Romance growing
Like a flower in the summer
You always keep me guessin'
Forever my wonderful
Hope you start undressin'
All my dreams and take me under

You are my cinema
I could watch you forever
Action, thriller
I could watch you forever
You are my cinema
A Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema...

[x3:]
Get up, get down
Three steps down
My DJ gonna break it down

Get up, get down
Lose that sound
Drop the bass

A cinema

You are my cinema
I could watch you forever
Action, thriller
I could watch you forever
You are my cinema
A Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema
