I've heard people say that
Too much of anything is not good for you, baby
Oh no
But I don't know about that
There's many times that we've loved
We've shared love and made love
It doesn't seem to me like it's enough
There's just not enough of it
There's just not enough
Oh oh, babe
Oh babe

My darling I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
Can't get enough of your love, babe

Lord some things I can't get used to
No matter how I try
It's like the more you give, the more I want
And baby, that's no lie
Oh no, babe

Tell me, what can I say? What am I gonna do?
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that you're givin' me?
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?

Girl, all I know is every time you're near
I feel the change
Somethin' moves
I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'

Darling I
I can't get enough of your love ,babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh no, babe

Girl, if I could only make you see
And make you understand
Girl, your love for me is all I need
And more than I can stand
Oh well, babe

How can I explain all the things I feel?
You've given me so much, girl you're so unreal
Still, I keep loving you more and more each time
Girl, what am I gonna do because you've blown my mind

I get the same old feelin' every time you're here
I feel the change
Somethin' moves
I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'

Darling I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe

Darling I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe

Darling I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh no, babe

Baby, let me take all of my life to find you
But you can believe it's gonna take the rest of my life to keep you

Oh no, babe
My darling I, can't get enough of your love babe
Yeah, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
Can't get enough of your love babe
Oh my darling I, can't get enough of your love babe
Oh babe

I can't get enough of your love babe
Oh babe
