Keep bangin on the walls
Keep bangin on the walls
OF FORTRESS EUROPE! 

2022 -A new European order 
Robot guards patrolling the border 
Cybernetic dogs are getting closer and closer 
Armoured cars and immigration officers 
A burning village in Kosovo 
You bombed it out now you're telling us go home 
Machine guns strut on the cliffs of Dover 
Heads down people look out! we're going over 
Burnin up! can we survive re-entry 
Past the mines and the cybernetic sentries 
Safe european homes built on wars 
You don't like the effect don't produce the cause 
The chip is in your head not on my shoulder 
Total control just around the corner 
Open up the floodgates Time's nearly up 
Keep bangin on the walls of Fortress Europe 

Keep bangin 
Keep bangin on the walls of Fortress Europe 
We got a right, know the situation 
We're the children of globalisation 
No borders only true connection 
Light the fuse of the insurrection 
This generation has no nation 
Grass roots pressure the only solution 
We're sitting tight 
Cos assylum is a right 
Put an end to this confusion 
Dis is a 21st century Exodus 
Dis is a 21st century Exodus 

Burnin' up can we survive re-entry 
Past the landmines and cybernetic sentries 
Plane, train, car , ferry boat or bus 
The future is bleeding coming back at us 
The chip is in your head not on my shoulder 
Total control around the corner 
Open up the floodgates Time's nearly up 
Keep bangin on the walls of Fortress Europe 

Keep bangin 
Keep bangin on the walls of Fortress Europe 
This is a 21st century Exodus 
This is a 21st century Exodus 

They got a right - listen not to the scaremonger 
Who doesn't run when they're feel the hunger 
From where to what to when to here to there 
People caught up in red tape nightmare 
Break out of the detention centres 
Cut the wires and tear up the vouchers 
People get ready it's time to wake up 
Tear down the walls of Fortress Europe
