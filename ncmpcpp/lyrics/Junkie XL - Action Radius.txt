I used to crystal up my dreams as a teen in my bedroom scene,
Playin' the poser,
(...)
Fanatic like l.a. locusts (?),
My quest,
Tempestious,
Euphonimous,
Plannin' bombing scipts,
Turnin' the chips,
Flex statuesque,
Make record sales spread around like acne,
Takin' over like the hover
Uncanny abilities rocking you whigpiece,
Days of playing air guitar,
Now your staring so far,
At crowds,
Open and scoping to a superstar.

Chorus:
Built me up to destroy again,
You healed me once from the void again,
Beyond limits is my action radius
Need your love to feel the poise and stand

Between scylia and charybdis,
Boredom versus debris,
Daily routines make moods vary like parkingmeters,
Feeling hollow like empty bottles,
In pieces like jigsaw puzzles,
Lack of purpose,
Like winos in disillusionment guzzle,
When problems operate like vortex on brain cortex,
Music could be more sex than porno flicks with chicks can pack,
Discontinuity,
Audience see is attraction like a magnet to mic and amp it,
Constantly...

(chorus)

...hey hello...

Last city with the baddest ditties got the crowds giddy,
This kitty got with me,
Swivvy and drippy,
At the after party,
In any land i'm getting more grace than presley,
From legions bigger than hooligans from chelsea,
My voice is considered golden like my dame shirley bassey,
My doses attack like tuberculosis from here to tallahssee,
Adrenaline got me spinning in bed reminiscin' at the marriot,
Never end the night period.
