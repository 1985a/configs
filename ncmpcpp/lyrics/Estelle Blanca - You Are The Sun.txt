[Estelle:]
Every little
Every little

[John Legend:]
The first time I met you
You were so quiet and cool you
Never thought that you would kiss my heart the way you did
All of the sadness in passing
Making me feel like I'm past it
But you reel me in in the sweetest way

Oh I'm so enamored by you
All in my music all you
Do you keep me surfing on the hope that we can be together, are you?
I hope you listen to this
I hope you get to feel this
Because everything is you
Come on

[Estelle & John Legend:]
Come close to me
Only your love can do me
Every little thing I do you are
Baby you know your special
I don't care what the rest do
Every little thing I do you are

[Estelle:]
If love had a face then it's you
Made for me how did you know
The best type of love who must have led you to hurt me
If there's anything I can do
Let me know I'll be a fool
But don't take advantage cause I will hate to have to leave you
Your touch makes me feel like a woman
Takes me beyond feeling human
When you touch me oh the smell of you
When we're alone it's beautiful
Makes me not want to leave you no
Everything is you

[Estelle & John Legend:]
Come close to me
Only your love can do me
Every little thing I do you are
Baby you know your special
I don't care what the rest do
Every little thing I do you are

Come close to me
Only your love can do me
Every little thing I do you are
Baby you know your special
I don't care what the rest do
Every little thing I do you are

[Estelle:]
Ooh when your lying next to me

[John Legend:]
I can't believe your next to me

[Estelle:]
It's only us in this moment

[John Legend:]
No interuptions we focus

[Estelle:]
Tell you I'm glad I risked it

[John Legend:]
God knows that I would have missed it

[Estelle:]
You're so amazing baby everything you do
Come close to me

[Estelle & John Legend:]
Only your love
Everything little thing I do you are
Baby you know your special
I don't care about the rest
Everything little thing I do you are
Baby
Baby you are
Baby
You are
Baby you are
Baby
