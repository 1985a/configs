Seems like the other day
My baby, he went away
He went away across the sea

It's been two years ago
That's when my baby go
That's when this letter it came to me

He said that we were through
He'd found somebody new
Oooh, let me think
Oooh, let me think
What can I do?

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no no no no no
Walking in the sand
Walking hand in hand
The night was so exciting
His lips were so inviting

Whatever happened to
The boy that I once knew
The boy who said he'd be true
What will happen to
The life I gave to you
What will I do with my heart now

(Remember) walking in the sand
(Remember) walking hand in hand
(Remember) walking in the sand

(Remember) walking in the sand
(Remember) walking hand in hand
(Remember) walking in the sand

(Remember) walking in the sand
(Remember) walking hand in hand
(Remember) walking in the sand

(Remember) walking in the sand
(Remember) walking hand in hand
(Remember) walking in the sand
