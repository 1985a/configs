Maria Maria 
She reminds me of a west side story 
Growing up in Spanish Harlem 
She's living the life just like a movie star 
Maria Maria 
She fell in love in East L.A. 
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah 
Played by Carlos Santana 
Stop the looting, stop the shooting 
Pick pocking on the corner 
See as the rich is getting richer 
The poor is getting poorer 
Se mira Maria on the corner 
Thinking of ways to make it better 
In my mailbox there's an eviction letter 
Somebody just said see you later 
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola 
Ahora vengo mama chola 
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola 
Ahora vengo mama chola 
I said a la favella los colores 
The streets are getting hotter 
There is no water to put out the fire 
Mi canto la esperanza 
Se mira Maria on the corner 
Thinking of ways to make it better 
Then I looked up in the sky 
Hoping of days of paradise 
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola 
Ahora vengo mama chola 
Maria you know you're my lover 
When the wind blows I can feel you 
Through the weather and even when we're apart 
It feels like we're together
