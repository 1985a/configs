Fall back in into the line and realize a time of no return,
Don't look back!
Fear evokes anxiety and overwhelms the emotions that we bleed.
Embrace your freedom!

Something that you need to know,
Of what it is we'll face;
An emotion that you cannot show,
But it has to be this way.

We lost ourselves deliberately to find ourselves a life of lesser pain.
Find a new Rhythm!
So we stand to look ahead and face ourselves to what we fear the most
A life that's uncertain!

Something that you need to know,
Of what it is we'll face;
An emotion that you cannot show,
But it has to be this way.

And it only seems so strange right now.
And it only feels to be different now.

And it only seems so strange right now.
And it only feels to be different now.

So we stand to look ahead and face ourselves to what we fear
Don't look back!
Don't look back!
Fall back in into the line and realize a time of no return,
Don't look, Don't look back!
