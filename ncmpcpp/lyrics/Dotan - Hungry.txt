Hit up the bottom, hearts will melt like ice
As the lights keep falling, makes you feel so small again
As we walk in circles, the blind leading the blight
No way of hiding, our heart is all we've got

I'm hungry for you my love, so come out and rescue me
Love is just not enough out in this war of needs

Drag your heart to the place where it belongs
While it's underwater, where my love will fill your bones
The clouds are shaking, and your palms began to crack
Hands against your eyes, see this love is all we've got

I'm hungry for you my love, so come out and rescue me
Love is just not enough out in this war of needs

It's a hive of honeybees trapped inside of our skin
Growing faster, stinging harder till we all give in

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm hungry for you, my love
Love is just not enough
I'm hungry for you, my love
Love is just not enough

I'm hungry for you, my love, so come out and rescue me
Love is just not enough out in this war of needs
I'm hungry for you, my love, so come out and rescue me
If love is just not enough out in this war of needs
I'm hungry for you, my love
Love is just not enough

It's a hive of honeybees trapped inside of our skin
Growing faster, stinging harder till we all give in
Ey yeah, yeah, yeah
