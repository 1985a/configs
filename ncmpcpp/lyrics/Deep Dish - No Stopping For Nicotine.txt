No stopping for nicotine 
No stopping for what you are 
No stopping for Benzedrine 
No stopping for rock 'n roll stars 

Seven minutes to rendezvous 
I'm committed to what you need 
I kind of what to hold on to you 
I want to be your best disease 

I want to take apart what you want 
I want to take you down memory lane 
I want to go behind a restaurant 
I want to be what you never became 

No stopping for nicotine 
No stopping for what you are 
No stopping for Benzedrine 
No stopping for rock 'n roll stars 

I'm gonna win it 
I let you down 
I want to take a drink from your glass 
I'm so down in it 
I'm underground 
I can't forget about touching your ass 

No stopping for nicotine 
No stopping for what you are 
No stopping for Benzedrine 
No stopping for rock 'n roll stars 

Now I'm in it to be like you 
I want to take you down memory lane 
I'm gonna win it 
It's up to you 
I want to be what you never became 

No stopping for nicotine 
No stopping for what you are 
No stopping for Benzedrine 
No stopping for rock 'n roll stars 

No stopping for nicotine 
No stopping for what you are 
No stopping for Benzedrine 
No stopping for rock 'n roll stars
