If I got locked away
And we lost it all today...
Tell me honestly...
Would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly
Would you still love me the same?

[R. City:]
Right about now...
If a judge for life me...
Would you stay by my side?
Or is ya gonna say good-bye?
Can you tell me right now?
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life
Shawty, would it be alright
Come and show me that you are down (ah-ha)

Now tell me would you really ride for me? (would you really ride for me?)
Baby, tell me would you die for me? (tell me would you die for me?)
Would you spend your whole life with me? (what's up?)
Would you be there to always hold me down?
Tell me would you really cry for me? (would you really cry for me?)
