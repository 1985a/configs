I heat up, I can't cool down
You got me spinnin' 'round and 'round
'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Where it stops, nobody knows

Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame, full of desire
Kiss me, baby, let the fire get higher

Abra-abracadabra 
I want to reach out and grab ya 
Abra-abracadabra, abracadabra 

You make me hot, you make me sigh
You make me laugh, you make me cry
Keep me burnin' for your love
With the touch of a velvet glove

Abra-abracadabra 
I want to reach out and grab ya 
Abra-abracadabra, abracadabra 

I feel the magic in your caress
I feel magic when I touch your dress
Silk and satin, leather and lace
Black panties with an angel's face

I see magic in your eyes
I hear the magic in your sighs
Just when I think I'm gonna get away
I hear those words that you always say

Abra-abracadabra
I want to reach out and grab ya
Abra-abracadabra, abracadabra

Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame, full of desire
Kiss me, baby, let the fire get higher, yeah yeah

I heat up, I can't cool down 
My situation goes ('round and 'round)
I heat up, I can't cool down
My situation goes ('round and 'round)
I heat up, I can't cool down 
My situation goes ('round and 'round)
